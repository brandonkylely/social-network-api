  ## Description

  This project serves as the backend of a simple social network application. API routes are available for creating new users, thoughts, and/or reactions. Users can add friends with other users, and manage their content by updating or deleting it.

  ## Installation

  Please run ```npm i``` to install the necessary dependencies before using. This application runs on MongoDB, so please prepare a Mongo database accordingly.

  ## Usage

  You can test each api route using an API development platform such as Insomnia. Make a request at each endpoint, sending a json body if necessary.
